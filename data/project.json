    "description": "This project provides contextual annotations and commentary about the American silent film, \"Camille,\" directed by and starring Alla Nazimova alongside Rudolph Valentino. \"Camille\" (1921) is an adaptation of a French romance novel by Alexandre Dumas fils (\"La Dame aux Camélias,\" 1848). \n\nThe annotations and prose included in this project were originally part of J. Reinschmidt's MA thesis chapter “Alla Nazimova, The Sewing Circle, and Silent Era Lesbian Reception,” which used AVAnnotate as a research use case to support Reinschmidt's argument about Nazimova’s impact on the early Hollywood film industry and audiences.",
